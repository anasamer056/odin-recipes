    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        It seems as if there are as many ways to prepare chili as there are cooks who make chili!
    </p>
    <p>
        Ground beef versus chunks, pork versus beef, pinto versus kidney beans, 
        beans versus no beans, red chili or green chili—the combinations,
        as the preferences for them, are endless.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons chili powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chipotle chili powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground oregano</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground coriander</li>

        <li>1 (14-ounce) can whole tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lime juice</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>1 (14-ounce) can kidney beans drained</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cornstarch, dissolved in a couple tablespoons of water</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>Here are all the steps you need to follow to make this delicious dish!</p>
    <ol>
        <li><h3>Make the chili paste</h3></li>
        <p>In a small bowl mix the chili powder, chipotle chili powder, ground cumin, oregano, thyme, and ground coriander seeds. Mix in water so that chili forms a light paste. Set aside.</p>
        <li><h3>Cook the bacon</h3></li>
        <p>Cook the bacon in a large skillet on medium high heat until crisp. Use a slotted spoon to remove from pan and set aside on a paper towel. Pour bacon fat from the pan into a separate container, reserve. When the bacon cools, crumble it into smaller pieces and set aside.</p>
        <li><h3>Brown the beef chunks in bacon fat</h3></li>
        <p>Increase heat to medium high, add back in 1 tablespoon of bacon fat. Working in batches so that you don't crowd the beef (crowding will steam cook the meat instead of browning it), brown the beef cubes on all sides, lightly salting as you cook the beef. Remove beef from pan, set aside.</p>
        <li><h3>Cook the onions</h3></li>
        <p>Add another tablespoon of bacon fat to the pan. Add the chopped onions and sauté until soft, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and jalapeño, cook until fragrant, about 1 minute more. Add the chili paste and cook for 2 to 3 more minutes</p>
        <li><h3>Combine the chili ingredients in a big pot, simmer, then cook slowly</h3></li>
        <p>Into a 6-quart, thick-bottomed Dutch oven, put onion-chili mixture, beef, bacon, tomatoes (break up the whole tomatoes with your fingers as you put them in the pot), water, lime juice and sugar. Heat the chili on medium high heat until it comes to a simmer. Then reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook for 1 1/2 hours. Then uncover and cook for another half hour, keeping the temperature at a place where you can maintain a simmer.</p>
        <li><h3>Thicken with cornstarch</h3></li>
        <p>Mix the cornstarch powder into a little water to dissolve the corn starch (otherwise you'll have lumps to deal with) and add to the chili to thicken it.</p>
        <li><h3>Add the kidney beans</h3></li>
        <p>Gently mix in the kidney beans. Add salt to taste. Adjust seasonings. Depending on the acidity of the tomatoes and lime juice you may need a little more sugar to bring the stew to balance. At this point you can also add a little more chili powder if you desire more heat.</p>
        <li><h3>Add toppings to serve</h3></li>
        <p>Sprinkle with grated cheddar cheese and chopped red onion. Serve with cornbread, tortilla chips, and/or rice.</p>
