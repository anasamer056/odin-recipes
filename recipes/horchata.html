    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Horchata (pronounced or-CHAH-tah) is a popular Mexican drink that is often described as a sweet rice milk beverage. Horchata is made out of rice, milk, vanilla, and cinnamon and is served in many Mexican restaurants.  Thereâ€™s an important balance to the creamy rice and cinnamon flavors found in horchata and this homemade horchata recipe is my favorite.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups uncooked long-grain white rice</li>
        <li>2 Mexican cinnamon sticks</li>
        <li>4 cups hot water</li>
        <li>2 cups milk , or almond milk</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
          <h3>Prepare Rice</h3>
          <p>Measure 1 1/2 cups of uncooked long-grain white rice. Rinse the rice thoroughly in cold water to remove excess starch.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Add Cinnamon Sticks</h3>
          <p>Include 2 Mexican cinnamon sticks into the mix. Cinnamon sticks will infuse a warm, aromatic flavor into the horchata.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Add Hot Water</h3>
          <p>Pour in 4 cups of hot water. The hot water will help the cinnamon sticks release their flavor into the mixture.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Add Milk</h3>
          <p>Include 2 cups of milk, or almond milk, as a substitute. The milk will give the horchata a creamy texture. You can use almond milk for a dairy-free option.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Add Vanilla Extract</h3>
          <p>Stir in 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract. Vanilla extract adds a sweet and aromatic note to the horchata.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Add Ground Cinnamon</h3>
          <p>Sprinkle 2 teaspoons of ground cinnamon into the mixture. This will enhance the cinnamon flavor and give your horchata a rich color.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Sweeten to Taste</h3>
          <p>Add 1/2 cup of granulated sugar to taste and mix well. Adjust the sugar according to your preference, making it sweeter if desired.</p>
        </li>
