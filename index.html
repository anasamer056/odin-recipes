                <p>It seems as if there are as many ways to prepare chili as there are cooks who make chili!
                    Ground beef versus chunks, pork versus beef, pinto versus kidney beans, beans versus no beans, red chili or green chili—the combinations, as the preferences for them, are endless.</p>

                <span>Horchata</span>
                <p>Horchata (pronounced or-CHAH-tah) is a popular Mexican drink that is often described as a sweet rice milk beverage. Horchata is made out of rice, milk, vanilla, and cinnamon and is served in many Mexican restaurants. There’s an important balance to the creamy rice and cinnamon flavors found in horchata and this homemade horchata recipe is my favorite.
